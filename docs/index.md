## Overview

This is a personal documentation site that summarizes my learning and work experience. This site contains two language editions: Chinese and English. You can refer to [wiki-kingen](https://github.com/eastsunrise/wiki-kingen/) for the Chinese edition.

This site is divided into several parts, as follows:

-   **Java** which I major in is the primary part including basic syntax, extension libraries and various framework based on Java.
-   **CS** part is mainly about basic knowledge of Computer Science, such as operating system, data structures, alogorithms, etc.
-   The third part is about **Python**, which is usually applied to programming that requires efficiency.
-   Besides, various other technologies that may be involved during development are included in the fourth part----**Development**.
-   As for other topics that are not closely related to development, they are allocated in **Misc**.
