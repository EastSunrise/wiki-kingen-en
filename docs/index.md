#### Welcome

This documentation is generalized from my learning and work experience, including two language
editions. Refer to [wiki-kingen](https://eastsunrise.github.io/wiki-kingen) for the Chinese edition.
As follows are the parts that the documentation is divided to:

**Java** which I major in is the primary part, including language references, extended libraries,
and many frameworks based on Java.

The part named **CS** is for all subjects or courses of fundamental technologies in Computer
Science (e.g. operating system, data structures, and algorithms).

The third part is for **Python** which is generally applied to programming that requires efficiency.

Besides, various technologies are involved when it occurs to development. All of extra knowledge are
included in the fourth part collectively called **Development**.

Finally, other knowledge points with little relevance to development are attached to miscellaneous
items, **Misc** for short.
