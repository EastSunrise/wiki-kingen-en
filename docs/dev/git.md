#### Overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system. Here are the [official](https://git-scm.com/doc) documentations and those for [liaoxuefeng's wiki](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600).

#### .gitignore

**Notes: **

##### Principle

1. Ignore files automatically generated by the system or environment, such as thumbnails by Windows, `.idea` directory by IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Ignore intermediate files generated from compiling, such as `.class` compiled by Java.
3. Ignore files that contain private information, such as configuration file of password or token.

##### Rules

1. A blank line matches no files.
2. A line starting with `#` serves as a comment.
3. An optional prefix `!` which negates the pattern. **It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.**
4. The slash `/` is used as the directory separator.
5. If there is a separator `/` at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories.
6. `**` matches multi-directories.
7. `?` and `[]` are the same as those in regular expression.

For example:

1. `/dir` to ignore the whole directory
2. `*.zip` to ignore all the files ending with '.zip'
3. `/dir/main.txt` to ignore the specified file
4. `!/dir/main.txt` not to ignore the file

##### Notes

**Files already tracked by Git are not affected.** To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use `git rm --cached`.

```shell
$ git rm -r --cached target
$ git commit -m '.gitignore'
```
